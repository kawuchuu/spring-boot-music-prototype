# spring-boot-music-prototype

This is a music streaming prototype, which will eventually be used for a later project. This prototype is used to help further my Java and backend skills. (I still suck at both)

**WARNING:** This project is a prototype and is __NOT__ designed for everyday purposes. Use at your own risk. This project has only been tested on Windows.
